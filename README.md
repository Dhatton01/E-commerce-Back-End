### Challenge:
This challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

> WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file\
> THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize\
> WHEN I enter schema and seed commands\
> THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data\
> WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application\
> THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database\

## Installation

To get started, clone or fork this repository to your local machine. In the root directory of the project, type in the terminal command line 'npm i' to download the dependencies. Initiate the database with 'mysql -u root -p', then 'source db/schema.sql' to create the tables. Exit the mysql terminal and from bash or zsh, type 'npm run seed' to seed the data into your tables. Now you can run 'npm start' to start your server!
